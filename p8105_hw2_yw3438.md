## Problem 1

``` r
# Import the data in Mr. Trash Wheel sheet
mr_trash_wheel = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                            sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
                            range = "A2:N338" ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))

# Import the data in precipitation data for 2018
pcptt_2018 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
                        skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = "2018") %>%
  drop_na(total)

# Import the data in precipitation data for 2017
pcptt_2017 = read_excel("./data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
                        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
                        skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = "2017") %>%
  drop_na(total)

# Combine precipitation datasets
pcptt_1718 = full_join(pcptt_2017, pcptt_2018) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

After reading and cleaning the data in Mr. Trash Wheel sheet, there are
285 observations of 14 variables in the dataset. The variables include
“dumpster, month, year, date, weight\_tons, volume\_cubic\_yards,
plastic\_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette\_butts, glass\_bottles,
grocery\_bags, chip\_bags, sports\_balls, homes\_powered”, among which
all the numbers in “sports\_balls” have been transformed into integers.

After reading and cleaning the data in 2018 Precipitation, there are 8
observations of 3 variables in the dataset “pcptt\_2018”. The variables
include “month, total, year”.

After reading and cleaning the data in 2017 Precipitation, there are 13
observations of 3 variables in the dataset “pcptt\_2017”. The variables
include “month, total, year”.

The total precipitation in 2018 is 23.5 and the median number of
sports\_balls in 2017 is 8

## Problem 2

``` r
# Read the data in pol-month
pol_month = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("prez"),
               names_to = "president",
               names_prefix = "prez_") %>%
  select(-day) %>%
  filter(value %in% c(1, 2)) %>%
  select(-value)
# In pol_month, the prez_gop data has a value of "2". These values are considered to be same as "1" in this case as they both show that they won.

# Read the data in snp.csv
snp = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[as.numeric(month)]) %>%
  arrange(year, month)

# Read and tidy unemployment data
unemployment = read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(jan:dec,
               names_to = "month") %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[factor(month)]) %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
  
# Merging snp into pol_month
  snp_pol = left_join(pol_month, snp, by = c("month", "year"))
# Merging unemployment data into one dataset
  snp_pol_unempl = left_join(snp_pol, unemployment, 
                             by = c("month", "year"))
```

The pol\_month dataset contains 822 rows and 9 colomns. The range of
years in pol\_month dataset is from 1947 to 2015. The names of key
variables in pol\_month are “year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop,
gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president”.

The snp dataset contains 787 rows and 4 colomns. The range of years in
pol\_month dataset is from 1950 to 2015. The names of key variables in
pol\_month are “month, day, year, close”.

The unemployment dataset contains 816 rows and 3 colomns. The range of
years in pol\_month dataset is from 1948 to 2015. The names of key
variables in pol\_month are “year, month, value”.

After merging snp and pol\_month, the new dataset, snp\_pol, contains
822 rows and 11 colomns. The range of years in pol\_month dataset is
from 1947 to 2015. The names of key variables in pol\_month are “year,
month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem,
president, day, close”.

After merging snp\_pol and unemployment, the new dataset,
snp\_pol\_unempl, contains 822 rows and 12 colomns. The range of years
in pol\_month dataset is from 1947 to 2015. The names of key variables
in pol\_month are “year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop, gov\_dem,
sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president, day, close, value”.

## Problem 3

``` r
